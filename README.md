A standard documentation for developing web application.

## Introduction

The complexity of modern software architecture requires collaborative development.

How to collaborate effectively? There is no square without rules, and it is difficult to coordinate without rules. For example, the formulation of traffic regulations is ostensibly to limit the right to drive, but actually to ensure the personal safety of the public. Imagine who dares to drive on the road without speed limit and traffic lights. For software, proper specifications and standards are not to eliminate the creativity and elegance of code content, but to limit excessive personalization, work together in a universally recognized unified way, improve collaboration efficiency and reduce communication costs. The blood of the software system is dissipated between the lines of the code. The quality improvement is to step on the pits as little as possible, eliminate the repeated pits, effectively improve the system stability and code the quality.

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) - HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a descriptive language that specifies webpage structure.
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
- [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.
