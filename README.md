## Introduction

The complexity of modern software architecture requires collaborative development.

How to collaborate effectively? There is no square without rules, and it is difficult to coordinate without rules. For example, the formulation of traffic regulations is ostensibly to limit the right to drive, but actually to ensure the personal safety of the public. Imagine who dares to drive on the road without speed limit and traffic lights. For software, proper specifications and standards are not to eliminate the creativity and elegance of code content, but to limit excessive personalization, work together in a universally recognized unified way, improve collaboration efficiency and reduce communication costs. The blood of the software system is dissipated between the lines of the code. The quality improvement is to step on the pits as little as possible, eliminate the repeated pits, effectively improve the system stability and code the quality.
